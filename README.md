# Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals who share similar characteristics, such as demographic data, purchasing habits, and behavioral patterns. Python is a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning, making it an excellent tool for customer segmentation projects.

One of the most widely used algorithms for customer segmentation is the K-Means clustering algorithm. It is a simple and efficient unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. The K-Means algorithm requires only a few inputs, including the number of clusters (K) and the dataset.

The following are the steps were involved in this customer segmentation project via Python using K-Means Algorithm:

Import necessary libraries: First, I imported necessary libraries.

Load and preprocess data: Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe and perform necessary preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling.

Determine the optimal number of clusters: The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).

Fit the K-Means model: Initialize and fit the K-Means model on the preprocessed data using the chosen K value.

Interpret the results: Analyze the clusters obtained by the K-Means algorithm and interpret the results to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

Overall, the customer segmentation project via Python using K-Means Algorithm is a straightforward and effective way to group customers based on their similarities, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences. This Customer Segmentation conducted resulted in the following clusters:

Prudent Elite: Cluster 0

Established Earners: Cluster 1

Silver Sages: Cluster 2

Financial Titans: Cluster 3

Trendsetters: Cluster 4

Millennial Moguls: Cluster 5

Each cluster is described by its size, average age, income, spending score, credit score, common card type, and common gender. These clusters were derived from customer data and can be used to target marketing strategies to specific customer groups.
